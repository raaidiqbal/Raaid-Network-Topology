This is the README file for Raaid's CS 331, Fall 2025, project repository

## Contents of this repository

### 1. Network Topology Analysis
Analysis of network topology and routing paths using traceroute data.

### 2. BGP Routing Analysis
Investigation of how data travels across the internet using BGP routing data, examining the "network of networks."

### 3. Reliable Transport
Analysis of TCP traces to demonstrate its key services.

### 4. DNS
This project analyzes how DNS works by examining real DNS traffic in Wireshark, using command-line tools like dig, and writing Python code to query hundreds of domains. The results compare Carleton's DNS resolver with Google's resolver, focusing on response behavior, IP differences, and TTL patterns.
