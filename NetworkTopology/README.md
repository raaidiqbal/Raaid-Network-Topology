This is the README file for Raaid's Network Topology project

CS 331, Fall 2025



## Directory contents



The purpose of this project was to test 6 different endpoints to obtain a picture of how Carleton College is connected to the wider internet. The comparison was done using traceroutes, pings, and RIPE.



Endpoints tested:


* Lahore University of Management Sciences
* London School of Economics
* University of Queensland
* University of California, Santa Cruz
* University of SÃ£o Paulo
* Microsoft Corporation   



Tools used:



* Traceroute (tracert): used to map the path and latency of packets to various global destinations



* Ping: used to measure average Round Trip Times (RTTs)



* RIPE Atlas: used to compare local and global latency measurements



IP lookup tools:

* RIPE
* https://www.submarinecablemap.com/
* whatismyipaddress.com



Visualization tools: Google Slides, and Google Sheets



The results showed that Carleton is connected through Hurricane Electric and Northern Lights. The US is very well connected with low latency, and Asia, Oceania, South America are less well connected.
